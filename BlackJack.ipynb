        "# CCS 1400 Project - A Game of Blackjack\n",
        "In this project you need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Requirements:\n",
        "1. The game needs to have one human player versus an automated dealer.\n",
        "2. The player can stand or hit.\n",
        "3. The player is allowed to pick their betting amount.\n",
        "4. You need to keep track of the player's total money.\n",
        "5. You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...\n",
        "6. **Use of OOP and classes are a must in at least some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in this project.**\n",
        "7. Complete the project by playing at least two rounds where you are able to show the steps defined under Game Play (shown below)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**You will need to use all that we have learned so far, and more, to finish this project.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hint: You can use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand."
